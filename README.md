# Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-Analyzer
Developed a program in Python to analyze and visualize an algorithmic stock trading strategy. The program is able to pull stock prices for a specified ticker using yfinance and allows the user to set a time range for the data. It then calculates and adds several technical indicators to the data, including a 20-day rolling average, standard deviation, upper and lower Bollinger bands, and the relative strength index (RSI). The program defines conditions for determining when to buy or sell the stock based on these technical indicators and creates a 'signal' column in the data to apply the conditions and resulting actions. The 'signal' column is then shifted by 1 row to take the buy action on the next day's open. The program loops through the data and keeps track of whether it is currently holding a position in the stock. The trading strategy implemented in the program is to buy when the RSI is under 30 and the closing price is less than the lower Bollinger band, and to sell when the RSI is above 70 and the closing price is above the upper Bollinger band or when the price falls below the set stop loss. The program calculates and displays the total profit as a percentage and visualizes the data by plotting the stock prices and marking the buy and sell points on the plot.
